# Changelog

Suite changelog. `owa-tools` ships as one distribution, so all console
scripts share one version.

Format: append a `## vX.Y.Z` section when tagging a release, then use
per-tool subsections inside that release when useful.

## v0.1.1 - 2026-05-11

Internal repo restructure. No user-visible behavior change: the wheel,
console scripts, import paths, and distribution metadata are identical
to v0.1.0.

- Collapse top-level layout under `src/`. All runtime packages
  (`owa`, `owa_cal`, `owa_core`, `owa_doctor`, `owa_drive`, `owa_graph`,
  `owa_mail`, `owa_people`, `owa_sched`) plus `tests/`, `completions/`,
  `packaging/`, and the former `tools/` (renamed to `scripts/`) now live
  under `src/`. The repo root keeps only `docs/`, `src/`, dotfolders,
  and top-level markdown so the README sits higher on GitHub.
- `pyproject.toml` switches to src-layout via `package-dir`. CI
  workflows, helper scripts, AGENTS.md mesh, and contributor docs
  retargeted accordingly.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-10

First public suite release. `owa-tools` consolidates the seven legacy per-tool
installs (`owa-cal`, `owa-mail`, `owa-graph`, `owa-doctor`, `owa-people`,
`owa-sched`, `owa-drive`) plus the new umbrella `owa` discovery binary into
one distribution. Auth still goes through `owa-piggy` as a separate package
via its subprocess JSON contract.

Suite-wide:

- Stdlib-only at runtime. No third-party deps.
- One suite version across all eight binaries.
- `owa list`, `owa schema`, `owa doctor`, `owa version` umbrella commands.
- Verified compatible with `owa-piggy` 0.8.0 (minimum supported 0.7.1).
- Migration guide for users coming from per-tool installs:
  `docs/migrating-from-individual-installs.md`.
- Release flow: PyPI via local `uv publish` (UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN from `.env`);
  GitHub Actions builds artifacts and creates the GitHub Release.
- Draft Homebrew formula at `packaging/homebrew/owa-tools.rb`.


### owa-cal

### owa-mail

### owa-graph

### owa-doctor

### owa-people

### owa-sched

### owa-drive

### owa (umbrella)

Thin discovery binary. Subcommands:

- `owa list` - JSON list of installed consumers and their versions.
- `owa schema [--tool <name>]` - aggregate `<tool> schema` output.
- `owa doctor [...]` - forwards to `owa-doctor probe`.
- `owa version` - umbrella version.

Real work lives in the per-tool binaries.
